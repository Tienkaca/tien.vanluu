Please answer these questions when researching about SVN:

1.   How many ways to create a new source in Server? Details.
There is 2 way:
Creating a Repository with the Command Line Client

	Create another folder inside SVN
	Open the command prompt (or DOS-Box), change into D:\SVN\ and type: svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs MyNewRepository
Creating The Repository With TortoiseSVN
	Open the windows explorer
	Create a new folder
	Right click on the newly created folder and select TortoiseSVN → Create Repository here...

2.1   Suppose that you have a Working copy named EXCERCISE1. Now coping to another folder named EXCERCISE2. Why can u still commit/update/add/delete files/folders in EXCERCISE2?
	Because it's also a working copy
2.2   Where does the SVN link of EXCERCISE2 link to?
	Repository server of EXCERCISE1
3.

4.   Which cases lead to "Update fail" in SVN?
	Repository is deleted
	Connection Error
	... 
5.
5.1   What are the differences between "Revert to this Revision" and "Revert changes from these Revision"?
	Revert to this Revision is used for a specific reversion
	Revert changes from these Revision is used for a set of reversions
5.2   Why can't we use Revert features when showing log from Repobrowser instead of Working Copy?
	Because there is no "Revert" option in Repo browser
5.3   If we want to revert change from this revision, we will do these steps:
Working copy -> Show log -> Chose older version which we want to roll back -> Chose "Revert change from this revision"
But we have a trouble here: Can't see any older version.
How to solve this problem?

	No action needed, BC it is the base version
