SVN questions:




Please answer these questions when researching about SVN:

1.   How many ways to create a new source in Server? Details.
new folder-> tortoiseSVN->create repository here

2.
2.1   Suppose that you have a Working copy named EXCERCISE1. Now coping to another folder named EXCERCISE2. Why can u still commit/update/add/delete files/folders in EXCERCISE2?
2.2   Where does the SVN link of EXCERCISE2 link to?

3.
3.1   When conflict occurs?
 when two or more persons made 
changes to the same place within a document.
3.2   What are the differences between "Conflict in a folder" and "Conflict in a file"?

3.3   What to do when conflicts occur?

4.   Which cases lead to "Update fail" in SVN?

5.
5.1   What are the differences between "Revert to this Revision" and "Revert changes from these Revision"?
5.2   Why can't we use Revert features when showing log from Repobrowser instead of Working Copy?
5.3   If we want to revert change from this revision, we will do these steps:
Working copy -> Show log -> Chose older version which we want to roll back -> Chose "Revert change from this revision"
But we have a trouble here: Can't see any older version.
How to solve this problem?
